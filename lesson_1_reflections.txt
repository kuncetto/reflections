How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It just highlights the changes between the two versions.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I am able to go back and forward through the history of without the need to handle manually different copies. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros are you can choose when the version is consistent while in the cons there is a chance you can lose all your work if you forgot to save it frequently.  

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because you can track dependency between files in each commit. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use 'git log' to see the commit history while use 'git diff' to view changes between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If something goes wrong you can go back and find where the issue comes from.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try to edit asteroids project code safely.

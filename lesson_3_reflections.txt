When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I want to share my work with the community or the development team whom I collaborate with.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because the repository could have some commits raising conflicts as they are pulled from remote to my local working directory. So it would be better to handle this operation manually.

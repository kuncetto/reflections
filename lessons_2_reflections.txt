What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A new .git folder is created in the repository folder. 
    Initializing a repository I can start tracking its content.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area just contains the files that will be committed.
    Despite of how small or large the project is, you can select a subset of
    files on which you'll be work on.
